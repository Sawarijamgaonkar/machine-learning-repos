# Movie Genre Classificatoin

## Goal

This project aims to accurately predict the genre(s) of a movie , improving the accuracy of movie recommendations by understanding user preferences based on genres.
## Methodology

Utilizing a combination of EDA techniques and machine learning algorithms, we have meticulously analyzed data to discern patterns and correlations associated with the description of each movie . Key steps include data cleaning, feature engineering, and insightful visualization to extract meaningful insights.
## Data Preprocessing 

Data preprocessing steps include:
1. Stop words removal
2. Lemmatization i.e. breaking words into ints root meaning or similar meanings
3. Vectorization using TF-IDF i.e. converting the words into numeric values based on similarities in words.
## Models Utilized

LinearSVC
## Libraries Used

1. numpy: For efficient numerical operations
2. pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
3. seaborn: For visually appealing statistical graphics
4. matplotlib: For comprehensive data visualization
5. Sklearn: For implementing machine learning algorithms
## Results
Accuracy: 94%


## Conclusion
Through LinearSVC model prediction is done for Movie Genre Classificaton.
